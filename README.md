**LLArmy** is a collection of small, specialized LlamaIndex-based agents and tools designed to create powerful agentic systems.

**PyPI:** https://pypi.org/project/llarmy/

**Repository:** https://github.com/llarmy

**Documentation:** Coming soon

## Overview

**NOTE:** This README is updated frequently as the project evolves. Check back for the latest features and examples!

### Context

- **LlamaIndex** provides excellent data structures for connecting LLMs with external knowledge
- **Agentic systems** require specialized, composable tools for complex workflows
- **Reusability** is key - developers shouldn't rebuild common agent patterns

### Proposed Solution

At its core, **LLArmy** provides a toolkit of specialized agents and utilities built on top of LlamaIndex. LLArmy helps provide the following advantages:

- **Pre-built agents** for common use cases, reducing boilerplate code
- **Composable tools** that can be combined to create complex agentic workflows
- **LlamaIndex integration** leveraging the power of existing data structures
- **Lightweight design** with minimal dependencies for maximum flexibility

Each agent and tool offers distinct use cases and customizable parameters. These can be combined and orchestrated to achieve various tasks:

- **Multi-step reasoning** workflows
- **Data processing** pipelines with AI assistance
- **Intelligent automation** for repetitive tasks
- **Custom agentic systems** tailored to specific domains
